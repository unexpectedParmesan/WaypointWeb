##Waypoint

Waypoint is a geolocation-based route creation and discovery platform. Users can browse and follow routes, which consist of a series of waypoints that include text and media. Possible use cases include scavenger hunts, pub crawls, city tours, alternate reality games, and exercise routes.

The native mobile version of the app was made using React Native and the Google Maps API. The web route creation companion was made with React, the Google Maps API, and Semantic UI. On the back-end, Waypoint uses a Node.js/Express server with a MySql database, managed with Bookshelf.js/Knex.
